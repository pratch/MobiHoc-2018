Dear colleagues,

Given the evolving situation of COVID-19 (coronavirus), the SICE 2020 organizing committee is closely monitoring developments and advisories from the Thailand government and health organizations. The health and safety of the SICE 2020 participants, and their families and associates is our prime concern. 

Considering the escalating situation of the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, it seems unlikely to hold the SICE 2020 Annual Conference as originally planned. We have been exploring various alternative options since we posted the last message on the SICE website. **We have decided to hold an online meeting from 23rd to 26th of September 2020** (the registration fees will be reduced largely). We are planning to hold an on-site SICE Annual Conference in Chiang Mai, Thailand in a few years. 

Peer review and publication process of our papers will be unchanged; however, we vastly extend the paper submission deadline. We also discount the registration fee, which will be announced soon on the [registration page](registration.html).

If you do not want to give an online presentation, we will accept withdrawal of submissions. You can withdraw your submission through the [PaperCept](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl#SICE20) before the deadline, and please email withdrawal requests to **sice2020-secretariat [at] sice.or.jp** after the deadline.

In order to have the safest possible conference, we will continue to monitor the situation of COVID-19 and seek the best format of SICE 2020. We will keep you informed of any further updates on the SICE 2020 website. 

We thank all of you in advance for your kind understanding and support in the middle of this challenging global situation. We hope that all of you stay safe and healthy.

Best regards,

Kou Yamada and Kosin Chamnongthai, SICE2020 General Co-chairs
