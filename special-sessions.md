# Special Sessions

Special Sessions (SSs) are organized by the SICE 2020 Committiee focusing on new topics or innovative applications of a new approach. Anyone who are interested in a specific SS can contribute research papers. Both regular and position papers can be submitted to SSs and go through corresponding review precesses. The paper must be submitted through [Papercept](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl#SICE20) by the due date. When submitting a special session paper, you will be asked to enter a code (e.g. <code>n74h1</code>) that corresponds to the session to which you wish to submit the paper. The codes will be listed below soon.
