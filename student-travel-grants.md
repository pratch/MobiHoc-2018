### Student Travel Grant Award (STGA)

We (Annual Conference/International Affairs Committee) have set up this grant award in order to encourage students' contribution from abroad and to support part of their travel expenses to SICE 2020. 

We strongly hope that many students from all over the world apply for this grant award. 

An STGA candidate should be an undergraduate/graduate student (at the time of the application) who attends SICE 2020 and presents his/her paper at SICE 2020. Applications are completed by sending an email with the following items to:  
**sice2020-secretariat(at)sice.or.jp (Replace “(at)” with @)** 
by the deadline July 1, 2020. 
1. Paper ID 
2. Paper title
3. Name of presenter
4. Date of birth
5. Final paper pdf

Recipients will be selected by our Committee based on the paper quality. Four weeks ahead of the conference period, the finalists will be announced directly to them. Each finalist is asked to send a copy of student ID at this stage. The winners will be awarded a prize at the closing ceremony:
- 1st winner – JPY50,000
- 2nd winner – JPY50,000 
- 3rd winner – JPY50,000
