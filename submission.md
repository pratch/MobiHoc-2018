The SICE Annual Conference 2020 accepts two types of submissions for review:

### Regular Paper
Full papers (6 pages in conference format) must be submitted for review. The accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into **IEEE Xplore Digital Library** as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases. Normal length for the final manuscript of the regular paper is 6 pages. Paper exceeding 6 pages may be submitted upon payment of overlength page charges. A maximum of 2 extra pages above 6 pages are permitted. The paper must be submitted through [Papercept](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl#SICE20) by the due date.

### Position Paper
Extended abstracts (2-4 pages in conference format) must be submitted for review. This category is provided for authors who want to present a timely review of research, a case study, and so on. This type of papers will **NOT be submitted for inclusion** into the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The paper must be submitted through [Papercept](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl#SICE20) by the due date.

### Special Sessions <img src="new.gif">

Special Sessions (SSs) are organized by the SICE 2020 Committiee focusing on new topics or innovative applications of a new approach. Anyone who are interested in a specific SS can contribute research papers. Both regular and position papers can be submitted to SSs and go through corresponding review precesses. The paper must be submitted through [Papercept](https://controls.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl#SICE20) by the due date. When submitting a special session paper, you will be asked to enter a code (e.g. <code>n74h1</code>) that corresponds to the session to which you wish to submit the paper. The codes will be listed on [Special Session page](special-sessions.html).
