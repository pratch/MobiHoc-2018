#### Bus to Chiang Mai
The cheapest way to get to Chiang Mai from Bangkok is by either government-run bus or private bus. Buses to Chiang Mai take about 10 or 11 hours and cost around 250 Baht for a fan-cooled, government bus. The government bus will make frequent stops and you are not guaranteed a seat. First-class government buses are slightly more expensive, go non-stop to Chiang Mai from Bangkok, and are very comfortable. 

Government buses depart from Bangkok’s Northern Bus Terminal (at Mo Chit) at least a dozen times per day. Private buses depart from various parts of the city, including the Khao San Road area. Buses arrive at Chiang Mai’s Arcade Bus Station, which is a few miles from the venue. If you are planning on taking the bus, consider that bus accidents are far more frequent in Thailand than plane or train accidents. 

#### Train to Chiang Mai
Another cheap option to get to Chiang Mai from Bangkok is by taking a train. There are around six trains each day that make the trip from Bangkok’s Hualumpong Station. The trains are rather slow considering the distance — the slowest takes about 15 hours to make the 470-mile journey. When buying a train ticket, you will need to choose between third-class seats (wooden benches, fan-cooled), second-class sleeper (cushioned seats that open into flat beds at night, air-conditioned), and first-class sleeper (private rooms shared by two people, air-conditioned).
