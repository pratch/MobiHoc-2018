### 1. Video Submission Deadline (provisional)
Please submit your pre-recorded presentation video (15 minutes/presentation) by **Wednesday 9th September 2020**. The place of submission will be announced later, and we will start accepting video uploads around the middle of August 2020.

### 2. Video Upload Requirements (provisional)
The pre-recorded presentation videos must satisfy the following requirements:
    
- The video must begin with the first slide displaying the presentation number (e.g. WeA01.01), title of the paper, the names of all authors, and their affiliations.
- The duration of the video must be less than 15 minutes.  
- The file size must be smaller than 200 MB.
- The format of the video file must be either avi, mov, mp4 or wmv.
- The video file must be named as the speaker’s presentation number with the period ( . ) replaced by an underscore <br> ( _ ). If the number after the period is one digit, please add a zero before the number. For example, if the speaker’s presentation number is WeA01.1 and the video format is mp4, then the video file name must be WeA01_01.mp4.

Uploaded videos will be encoded into the streaming video format with the following configuration:
    
1. Video bit rate: **2M [bps]**
2. Video size: **1280 x 720 [pixels]** (Aspect ratio 16 : 9)
3. Video frame rate: **60 [fps]**

If the specification of an uploaded video does not match the encoding configuration above, the specification will be adjusted automatically.

### 3. Software for Preparing Screencast Presentations (optional)
When the presentation video is prepared in screencast form, the speaker's voice is overlaid along with the presentation slides. Also, you can place a small window displaying yourself over your slide show.
The subsections below briefly explain how to record and edit screencast videos. (It is not necessary for you to prepare your presentation in screencast form.)

#### 3.1 Recording videos
The following software programs can be used for recording screencast presentations:

- **PowerPoint (Windows, Mac):**
    - Get into the presentation mode by going for "Slide Show -> Record Slide Show" on the main menu. Turn on the camera preview if you want to display yourself.
    - Start recording your presentation by clicking "RECORD".
    - Save the recorded presentation as an mp4 video file by going for "File -> Export" on the main menu.

- **Zoom (Windows, Mac, Linux):**
    - Start a meeting with you being the only participant. Also switch on your web camera if you want to display yourself.
    - Share the application window containing your presentation by clicking "Share Screen" on the bottom menu.
    - Start recording your presentation by clicking "Record" on the bottom menu. The video file in an mp4 format will be produced after ending the meeting.

- **OBS Studio (Windows, Mac, Linux):**
    - Set the format of the output video file to mp4 by going for "File -> Settings" on the main menu. 
    - Include the application window containing your presentation into the main frame by clicking the "+" bottom on the "Source" panel and then choosing "Window Capture". At this moment you can also include the input of your web camera by choosing "Video Capture Device".
    - Start recording your presentation by clicking "Start Recording" on the "Controls" panel. The video file will be produced automatically in your default video folder.

#### 3.2 Editing videos

There is no need to record a complete presentation at once as you can edit recorded videos. For example, you can cut out NG scenes or extract well-taken scenes by using the following software programs:

- **Photos (Windows)** is native software provided for Windows, and can be used for trimming and merging videos.

- **iMovie (Mac)** is native software provided for Mac, and can be used for trimming and merging videos.

- **DaVinci Resolve (Windows, Mac, Linux)** is freely available software, and suitable for those familiar with video editing as advanced manipulations are possible.

The final video must satisfy the requirements described in Section 2 above. If your video file size exceeds 200 MB, you could try using a plain white background or reducing animations. You could also consider lowering the resolution of the video itself.
