### Purpose and Scope

SICE Annual Conference 2020 will be held in Chiang Mai, Thailand during September 23-26. This is the first time the SICE Annual Conference is held in ASEAN region. On this occasion, it is highly meaningful to deepen the relationship between SICE and related academic communities in ASEAN and the neighbor countries in Asia, and to establish a new Asian network in the field of system engineering including measurement and control through this activity. We believe that it is beneficial to bring together professors and engineers who had experiences of study and/or research in Japan, their ex-supervisors in Japan, and their current students for having an opportunity of communication and discussion toward the network build-up.

To this end, SICE has decided to hold a very special half-day event named **“ASEAN Networking Workshop”** in conjunction with SICE2020. The workshop is financially supported by industries in Japan and Thailand as well as SICE. A representative from each ASEAN country will deliver a keynote speech on the past, present and future of system engineering in the country and on the perspective of cooperation between Japan and ASEAN countries. Further, high-rank persons from JICA, SICE, and the industrial sponsors will share their ideas with the audience.

We sincerely invite those people who received Ph.D. or master degree in one of Japanese Universities or stayed at least six months as a postdoc in Japan to attend this workshop. We also encourage those people to bring his/her ex-supervisor(s) in Japan and current student(s) in order to make the workshop more attractive toward ASEAN networking. We set up a scholarship for the current students in ASEAN countries to attend SICE2020 as well as this workshop.
