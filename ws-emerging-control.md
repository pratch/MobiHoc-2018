| 10:00 - 10:10 <img width="100"/> | **Opening of the Workshop**<br>**Speaker:** Md Abdus Samad Kamal|
| 10:10 - 11:00  | **Talk 1:** Anticipative Guidance of Connected and Autonomous Cars for Energy Efficiency<br>**Speaker:** Ardalan Vahidi, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, USA. Web: [https://cecas.clemson.edu/~avahidi](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~avahidi)<br><br>**Outline:** Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) are marketed for their increased safety, driving comfort, and time saving potential. With much easier access to information, increased processing power, and precision control, they also offer unprecedented opportunities for energy efficient driving. This talk highlights the energy saving potential of connected and automated vehicles based on first principles of motion, optimal control theory, and practical examples from our previous and ongoing research. Connectivity to other vehicles and infrastructure allows better anticipation of upcoming events, such as hills, curves, slow traffic, state of traffic signals, and movement of neighboring vehicles. Automation allows vehicles to adjust their motion more precisely in anticipation of upcoming events, and save energy. Opportunities for cooperative driving could further increase energy efficiency of a group of vehicles by allowing them to move in a coordinated manner.  Energy efficient motion of connected and automated vehicles could have a harmonizing effect on mixed traffic, leading to additional energy savings for neighboring vehicles.<br>We present analytical and experimental results from a US Department of Energy funded project in which we are exploring the impact of anticipative vehicle guidance on energy efficiency of CAVs and surrounding traffic. The benefits are shown in simulated scenarios and, also in a novel vehicle-in-the-loop experiment on a test track. <br> |
| 11:10 - 12:00  | **Talk 2:** Smart-Driving in Partially Connected Vehicle Environment using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control<br>**Speaker:** Md Abdus Samad Kamal, Division of Mechanical Science and Technology, Gunma University, Japan. Web: [https://www.mst.st.gunma-u.ac.jp/kamal/](https://www.mst.st.gunma-u.ac.jp/kamal/) <br><br>**Outline:** Smart-driving indicates the efficient driving behavior that also influences other vehicles to enhance their driving performances. Such behavior can be realized through fully traffic anticipation that enhances the driving intelligence and strengthens the ability to take early vehicle control action, e.g., lane change and speed adjustment, in a dynamically varying traffic environment. At first, the concept of smart-driving in a fully connected vehicle environment using a fast nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) will be introduced in the case of single lane and multi-lane roads.  <br>Next, the concept of road-speed profile (RSP), the virtual traffic speeds along the road as a continuous function of the longitudinal position, will be introduced, which will be followed by estimation and evaluation of the RSP using NGSim traffic data. Finally, an enhanced smart-driving scheme in the context of multi-lane traffic will be formulated by incorporating information of the RSP in the control framework. The scheme aims to improve the perception of the preceding traffic and enable cooperative driving on a multi-lane road. Finally, evaluation using real driving data and in AIMSUN microscopic traffic simulator will be presented. |

| 13:00 - 13:50  | **Talk 3:** The Eco-Routing Problem: Challenges and Solution Strategies for Electrified Vehicles<br>**Speaker:** Giovanni De Nunzio, Control, Signal and System Department, IFP Energies Nouvelles, France<br><br>**Outline:** E-mobility has been identified as an important means to reduce energy consumption and emissions of transportation. In an effort to comply with more and more stringent decarbonization measures, automakers are planning to significantly reduce the sales of vehicles solely powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs), and promote vehicle electrification. However, at least today, the main disadvantage of EVs and rechargeable HEVs is a relatively short range compared to cars with internal combustion engines. At route planning level, eco-routing is the strategy that makes use of topological and traffic information about the road network to compute an optimal route in terms of energy consumption. Such a strategy can be effectively used to reduce range anxiety and extend the driving range especially of electrified vehicles.<br>However, eco-routing for electrified vehicles implies two major difficulties in the design both at modeling and algorithmic level. The first challenge lies in the accuracy of the energy consumption model, whose role is to estimate the energy cost on each elementary road segment. Energy cost of each segment of the road network depends on vehicle parameters and powertrain, but also on road slope and more importantly on the vehicle speed profile, which needs to be predicted. The second challenge in the eco-routing for electrified vehicles consists in imposing constraints at routing level over the entire route. Such constraints typically aim to enforce problem feasibility, by imposing that the battery state of charge (SOC) stays within the physical limits at any time along the route, or additional problem-related desired behaviors, such as a maximum travel time or a desired final SOC at the end of the trip. This problem is typically formulated either as an integer programming problem, or as a resource-constrained shortest-path problem (RCSPP) on graphs, which are both known to be NP-hard problems.<br>In this talk, both challenges will be addressed. Firstly, modeling methods to correctly predict the driving behavior and the speed profiles of vehicles will be discussed, as well as methods to estimate the energy and fuel consumption of electrified vehicles. Secondly, different optimization problem formulations and algorithmic solutions of increasing degree of complexity will be described to solve the eco-routing problem for EVs and HEVs. |
| 14:00 -14:50  | **Talk 4:** Hierarchical Traffic Congestion Control in Urban Networks<br>**Speaker:** Mohsen Ramezani, Transport Engineering, School of Civil Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia<br><br>**Outline:** Accurate monitoring and efficient control of transportation systems remain a big challenge, due to the complexity and extent of transportation networks, unpredictability of travelers choices (in terms of route, departure time, and mode of transport), and the uncertainty in their reactions to the control. Over decades, control strategies based on disaggregated traffic flow models, which model behavior of every vehicle, have been proposed and applied for isolated intersections and arterials. However, large-scale network control schemes based on microscopic modeling require a tremendous amount of data and thus are computationally intractable. Instead, macroscopic models that only describe the aggregated behavior of traffic networks, and relying on less information, are well-suited for large-scale transportation system analysis. An instance of such models is the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) that aims at simplifying the micro-modeling of urban networks where the collective traffic flow dynamics of subnetworks capture the main characteristics of traffic congestion. This talk will discuss network-level control of urban traffic utilizing the MFD modeling. |
| 15:00 - 15:50  | **Talk 5:** Cooperative Control of Connected-Automated Vehicles at Intersections Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control <br>**Speaker:** Md Abdus Samad Kamal, Division of Mechanical Science and Technology, Gunma University, Japan. Web: [https://www.mst.st.gunma-u.ac.jp/kamal/](https://www.mst.st.gunma-u.ac.jp/kamal/) <br><br>**Outline:** Anticipative optimal driving of vehicles, considering the microscopic dynamics of the preceding traffic and signal timings at the intersection, can bring great improvement in the traffic flows, fuel consumption, and emission of CO2 gas. For automated driving vehicles and traffic management systems, such anticipative decisions can be realized using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) since the dynamics of individual vehicles and their interactions are highly nonlinear. In this workshop, we would like to present NMPC solutions for two different traffic scenarios. <br>Firstly, we present a coordination scheme for fully connected and automated vehicles at an intersection without using any traffic lights. All vehicles approaching the intersection are globally coordinated to realize smooth flows at the intersection. The optimal trajectories of the vehicles are computed in an NMPC framework based on the avoidance of their cross-collision risks around the intersection under relevant constraints and preferences.  <br>Secondly, we addressed a mixed manual-automated traffic scenario at an isolated intersection where automated vehicles need to be controlled efficiently considering the dynamics of manually driven vehicles and traffic signal timings. The traffic signals are optimized in a receding horizon control framework that aims at minimizing the total crossing time of all vehicles, considering their dynamical states. Using broadcasted optimal signal changing times, the automated vehicles tune their speed in order to cross the intersection with minimum stop-delay.  The scheme has been evaluated with various penetration of automated vehicles in a microscopic traffic simulator.  |
