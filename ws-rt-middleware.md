### Tutorial: <br> RT-Middleware Tutorial for Beginners

### Main Organizer
- Noriaki Ando, AIST, Japan

### Co-organizer
- Kenichi Ohara, Meijo University, Japan

### Statement of objectives
RT-Middleware is a software platform that streamlines the development of robot, IoT and distributed control and measurement systems. Since a robot system is constructed by combining a large number of modularized software called RT-Components, it is easy to change and expand the system, as well as inheriting existing software assets and components created by others. The seminar will explain the outline of RT-Middleware and how to create RT-Components. Students will be required to prepare their own PCs and actually create RT-Components in a practical format, and combine them with existing components to construct a simple system. By taking this course, you will be able to master the RT-Component design method, implementation method, and system integration method. This course will be held online by using Zoom.

### Intended audience
- Robot/IoT/Control-measurement systems software developers
- Robot/IoT/Control-measurement systems researchers

### Speakers

Noriaki Ando, Ph.D., is a team leader of the Software Platform Research Team, Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center, AIST. He received his ME and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Tokyo, in 1999 and 2002, respectively. From April 2003, he was a Research Scientist at Intelligent Systems Research Institute in AIST.
He has been engaged in a wide variety of research on robot software architecture, tele-operation, robot system integration, robot middleware and its standardization. He has also been involved in standardization activities at OMG, an international standards body. He proposed and standardized a specification of the robotic technology component (RTC) and implemented OpenRTM-aist based on the RTC standard.

|11:00-11:50 ICT<br>(13:00-13:50 JST)<img width="140"/>|**Part 1: Overview of OpenRTM-aist and RT-Component programming**<br>**Lecturer:** Noriaki Ando (AIST)<br>**Outline:** RT-Middleware (OpenRTM-aist) is a software platform for building robot systems in a component-oriented manner. By using RT-Middleware, existing components can be reused and a module-oriented flexible robot system can be constructed. This section describes the outline of RT-Middleware and the functions and programming flow of RT-Components.|
