# {{ page.title }}

The theme of workshops should focus on active areas of research and technology, in order to provide stimulating ideas for on-going and future topics. Tutorials should provide introduction on established fields of research and technology. The session can be half-day or full-day long. We encourage state of the art programs with high level of interest, impact, creativity, and innovation that will attract a broad audience. Workshops and tutorials focusing on academia-industry partnership and technology transfer are also welcome.
